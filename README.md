This repository provides access to metabolic reconstructions from <b>Plata et al. Growth promotion and antibiotic induced metabolic shifts in the gut microbiome.</b>

The two jupyter notebooks contain code used to predict the ability of individual reconstructions to use individual C sources for growth and metabolite essentiality across random media compositions.
